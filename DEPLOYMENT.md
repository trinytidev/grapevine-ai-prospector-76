Your app is now **production-ready** for personal use! Here's how to deploy it:

### Option 1: Deploy on Lovable (Recommended)
1. Click the **"Publish"** button in the top-right corner of Lovable
2. Your app will be live at: `your-app-name.lovable.app`
3. **Done!** Your app is now accessible from anywhere

### Option 2: Local Development Server

npm run dev
# Or if you prefer:
bun dev
```
Access at: `http://localhost:5173`

### Option 3: Build for Production
```bash

```

## 🔐 Authentication Setup

### For Testing (Disable Email Confirmation)
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/shtvgvnznqpinjbbrzjz/auth/settings)
2. Turn **OFF** "Confirm email" 
3. This allows instant signup without email verification

### For Production (Enable Email Confirmation)
